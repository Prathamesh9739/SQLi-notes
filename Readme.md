# SQLi Learning Notes

Welcome to my personal notes on SQL Injection (SQLi) techniques, from basics to advanced methods. This PDF is a summary of what I've learned through hands-on practice, compiled for educational purposes to help others understand web vulnerabilities and how to defend against them.

## About the PDF
This document covers key concepts like:
- Basic SQLi exploitation (e.g., union-based attacks).
- Advanced techniques (e.g., blind SQLi and error-based methods).
- Prevention strategies, such as using prepared statements and input sanitization.

It's based on my experiences and is meant as a quick reference for ethical hacking enthusiasts, developers, or anyone studying cybersecurity. The PDF is available in this repo—feel free to download and use it for learning!

## Attribution
These notes are inspired by the excellent SQL Injection room on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/). All credit goes to their platform for the foundational training. If you're new to this, I highly recommend signing up and completing their challenges yourself—it's a safe, legal way to practice.

## How to Use
1. Download the PDF from the repo files.
2. Read through the sections while practicing in a controlled environment (e.g., your own virtual lab).
3. Experiment ethically: Set up a local vulnerable app using tools like DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application) to test concepts without harming real systems.
